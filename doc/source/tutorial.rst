Testing
-------

If in one hand the library doesn't handle exceptions or perform any
conformance checking on input, it has been widely tested through
`unit testing methodology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing>`_,
decreasing possibilities of unexpected behaviours.
Python `unittest â€” Unit testing framework <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.html>`_
has been used.

Around 250 tests are provided and are listed in :doc:`unittest`.
